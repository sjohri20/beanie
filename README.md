# BEANIE: group Biology EstimAtion iN sIngle cEll

BEANIE is a python package for differential expression analysis in single cell RNA-seq data. It estimates group-level biology between two treatment groups by identifying statistically robust gene signatures. It uses a subsampling based approach to account for over-representation of biology due to differing numbers of cells per sample, and hence helps to reduce the effects of sample biases in differential expression analysis.
